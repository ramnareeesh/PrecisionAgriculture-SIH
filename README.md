## Problem Statement Title

Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, using artificial intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system.

## Problem Description

- In modern agricultural practices, efficient water management plays a critical role in achieving optimal crop yields, conserving water resources, and maintaining ecological balance.
- However, existing irrigation systems often lack the precision required to deliver water tailored to the actual needs of crops, leading to water wastage, suboptimal plant growth, and environmental degradation.
- This problem is particularly pronounced in piped and micro irrigation networks, where traditional methods of manual control fail to adapt dynamically to varying soil moisture conditions within the root zone of crops.
- The core issue lies in the absence of an automated mechanism that can regulate the release of water based on real-time soil moisture availability. The inconsistency in water distribution and the inability to synchronise irrigation with crop water requirements result in detrimental outcomes for both the agricultural yield and water conservation efforts.
- To address this problem, there is a compelling need for an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enable the automatic regulation of valves for water release in piped and micro irrigation networks.
- By incorporating AI-powered soil moisture monitoring and decision-making processes, this solution aims to bridge the gap between water supply and crop demand, while also optimising resource utilisation and minimising environmental impact.

## Key Challenges

  1.  Dynamic Water Demand: Crops have varying water requirements influenced by factors such as growth stage, weather conditions, and plant type. Developing an AI system capable of accurately predicting these dynamic water demands is a complex challenge. 
  2. Real-time Data Integration*: Integrating real-time soil moisture data from multiple sensors across a field into a centralised AI system requires robust data collection, transmission, and processing mechanisms. 
  3. Algorithm Precision: Designing AI algorithms that can effectively analyse soil moisture data, historical trends, and other relevant parameters to make accurate decisions about water release timing and quantities. 
  4. Valve Control Mechanism: Developing an automated valve control mechanism that can respond swiftly and accurately to the AI's recommendations while considering the physical characteristics of the piped and micro irrigation network. 
  5. Adaptability: Ensuring that the AI system can adapt to changing environmental conditions, crop types, and variations in soil properties over time. 
  6. User-Friendly Interface:* Designing a user-friendly interface that allows farmers and irrigation managers to monitor and intervene in the system as needed, while also trusting in the AI's autonomous decisions. 
  7. Economic Viability: Balancing the potential costs of implementing an AI-driven system with the expected benefits in terms of increased crop yield, water savings, and operational efficiency.

## Proposed Solution

- Our solution entails the development of a comprehensive AI-driven irrigation management system tailored for piped and micro irrigation networks.
- The core idea is to enable the automatic regulation of water valves based on real-time soil moisture data obtained from strategically placed sensors within the crop's root zone.
- By leveraging artificial intelligence/machine learning models, it will dynamically adjust valve operations to precisely match the crop's water requirements at any given moment based on the calculations done by the model on the input parameter.
- All of this will be presented in a user friendly interface in a language of the farmerâ€™s choice.We can also integrate voice controls to help him if he is not comfortable with reading everything from the screen.
